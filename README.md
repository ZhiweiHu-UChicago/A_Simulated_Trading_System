### A_Simulated_Trading_System
This is originally a Class Project I finished at UChicago FinMath Program, in the course Computing for Finance in Python, Fall 2020.
I am posting the code here and commit to revise and update it frequently.

Generally, a Trading System would include two participants, each participant has so many functions to be implemented:
* Exchange (Order books and the Matching Engine...)
* Traders ï¼ˆBalance Book, Strategy Section, Risk Section, PnL Statistics...)

A good resource of developing a matching engine could be found here:(in Chinese)
